Report to Blue Shift Campaign

[h1]General[/h1]

The [b]Survivial-Mode[/b] worked from ba_canal1 after I noticed
to update the configuration files for each map.
The maps always gives you a cretain amount of
Default-Ammo and even some [b]Armour[/b].

The Map-Changes are very [b]frequent[/b] and
don't need any Respawn-Points.

The [b]Soundtrack[/b] of Half-Life have been
used here and are [b]not fitting[/b] very well.

[h1]Weapon-Problem![/h1]

The Weapons are [b]not respawning[/b].
That means, that no more than one person
can get a Crowbar, Medkit,
Shotgun, Rocket-Launcher and so on.

Apperantly some Config-Value is not set correctly
and should being able to fix that quickly.

[b]Classic-Mode[/b] weapons are not aviable on this Chapter.
And I think we have to [b]Deal with it[/b].

[h1]Multiplayer-Compatibility[/h1]

Some maps are [b]not adapted[/b] properly on Multiplayer.
Of course I didn't noticed that when
I was [b]testing[/b] the maps in Singleplayer.
I am not sure if [i]Install_bshift_Support.bat[/i] overlooked that.

[b]ba_security1[/b]
Door closed as soon a person passed
through and trapped the people outside.

[b]ba_yard5a[/b]
Some details and a ladder disappears as soon
somebody go through the hole in the gate.
Also an invisible wall will block the people at the gate.

[b]ba_xen3[/b]
A Manta-Ray blows up an important island,
which people need to cross over to progress.

[b]ba_power1[/b]
Elevator disappeared to preventing Map-Change,
which it looks pretty ugly.

The grating floor in Secret-Room turned invisible
as soon as a person leaves the room.

[h1]Other Problems[/h1]

[b]ba_security2[/b]
Ammo-Respawning should be disabled
and the elevator needs a 33%-Check (not 66% this time).

[b]ba_yard3[/b]
A Lambda-Square Texture under the dying Scientist should be invisible.

[b]ba_yard5[/b]
People can nowhere hide at the beginning.

[b]ba_yard5a[/b]
Dr. Rosenberg pushes people off when they try to climb on him.

[b]Xen maps[/b]
Healing-Pools should heal more than 1 HP per tick.

[b]ba_power1[/b]
A Bullsquid doesn't react to shooting.

[b]ba_power2[/b]
People can troll with the Coolant-Flooding-System.
A Human-Tower after the Coolant-Bridge Section can
skip an entire Section and should be prevented.

[b]ba_power1[/b] from [i]ba_power2[/i]
This is a big one Problem.
A 66%-Trigger brings people back to [i]ba_power2[/i]
as soon they enter [i]ba_power1[/i] from [i]ba_power2[/i].

An attemt to skip [i]ba_power1[/i] to [i]ba_teleport2[/i] failed too.
Because an env_global havn't got the value that needs to progress.

So I need to [b]skip two maps[/b]: [i]ba_power1[/i] and [i]ba_teleport2[/i].
We end up on [i]ba_outro[/i], the last map of the Campaign.

[b]ba_outro[/b]
Survivial-Mode needs to be disabled there.

[h1]Conslusion[/h1]

Half-Life Blue Shift failed the Test-Run and needs to be
optimized before Blue Shift can be tested again.

Those points needs to be fixed before Blue Shift can be tested again:
[list]
  [*]GENERIC - Enable Weapon-Respawning (not Ammo-Respawning)
  [*]ba_security1 - Door should stay open
  [*]ba_yard5a - Prevent Details from disappearing
  [*]ba_yard5a - Remove invisible wall at the Hole in the Gate
  [*]ba_yard5a - Prevent Rosey from pushing off people
  [*]ba_xen3 - Prevent Manta-Ray from blowing up the island
  [*]ba_power1 - Prevent 66%-Trigger from moving back to ba_power2
[/list]

Those can be fixed after a successful Test-Run:
[list]
  [*]GENERIC - Remove Armour from Default-Give at map-spawning
  [*]ba_security2 - Disable Ammo-Respawning
  [*]ba_security2 - Add 33%-Check at Elevator
  [*]ba_yard2 - Add Headcrabs as a Map-Change condition
  [*]ba_yard3a - Add Padlock and Key
  [*]ba_yard3 - Turn Lambda-Square Texture invisible
  [*]ba_xen* - Healing-Pools should heal 10 HP per tick
  [*]ba_power1 - A func_wall that looks like Elevator
  [*]ba_power1 - A Bullsquid doesn't react to shooting
  [*]ba_power1 - Prevent floor in secret room from turning invisible
  [*]ba_power2 - Prevent Coolant-Flooding-Trolling
  [*]ba_power2 - Prevent Skipping after Coolant-Bridge Section
  [*]ba_outro - Disable Survivial-Mode
[/list]

[b]Thank you[/b] at all, who was playing on the Test-Run
for helping me tessting the Campaign.
