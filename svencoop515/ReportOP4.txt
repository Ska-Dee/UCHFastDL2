[h1]Report to Opposing Force Campaign on Sven Co-op[/h1]

The [b]Survivial-mode[/b] is disabled on the entire Campaign.
Also the [b]Keep_inventory[/b] is not enabled.
That means you'll lose the collected Ammo and Armour.
Also there are no Checkpoints because the maps are so small.
The number of Map-Changes is pretty high.
In other words, many unpleasant [b]Loading-Zones[/b].
We are suppoust to have a [b]Nightview-Goggles[/b],
but we only have Flashlights.

The Soundtrack have been replaced with the Half-Life ones.
At some places an [b]unfitting Soundtrack[/b] will play.

[b]Ropes are missing![/b]
Some places, where ropes are suppoust to be there,
are replaced with ladders, platforms,
a brush as electric wire or simply nothing.

There are many hidden [b]Chumtoads[/b] around the Campaign.
Well ok, I can deal with it.

Looks like I need to install trigger_once_mp's
to count people and block rushers until a cretain amount of %.
(Usually 66% of living people required)

After the crash, everyone died and I spawned
somewhere in a void with a large rotating rock-donut.

[b]of3a2 (We Are Not Alone)[/b]
Something on this map causes the Server to crash / restart.
I have absolutly no clue what exactly causes the crash.

[b]of4a2 (Vicarious Reality)[/b]
One of the func_pushable is not working to get a Secret Area,
But you can climb on a teammate to reach the Secret Area.

[b]of4a5 (Vicarious Reality)[/b]
I was surprized that there was already an Anti-Rush Mechanic installed.
A bug causes that a door closes for no reason and the people could not progress to the next map.
A Cheat was required to overwrite the door to open again.

[b]of4a4 (Pit Worm's Nest)[/b]
An interesting fact is that the Pit Worm have 13371337 Health on it.

[b]of5a2 (Foxtrot Uniform)[/b]
[i]Nuclear Mission Jam[/i] at the Sewers. WTF?!?!?

[b]of6a4 (The Package)[/b]
Lets defuse the Nuke and Barney should open a door.
But the Barney had to disappear and people are one again stuck on the map.
An another Cheat was required to progress the map.

[b]of6a5 (Worlds Collide)[/b]
We didnt got a chance to play on this map.
In other words:
[b]THE FINAL BOSS GENE WORM IS MISSING![/b]
[b]THE SAME GOES FOR THE ENDING AFTER THE BOSS![/b]
Apperantly the Boss is bugged and they skipped the map.

Conclusion:
A ton of optimizion is required to get OP4 running without rushing and problems.
I wanna change those Points before get the Campaign running:
[list]
  [*]Prevent Server crashes
  [*]Enable Survivial-Mode (Maybe with Checkpoints)
  [*]Enable Keep Inventory
  [*]Add correctly working Soundtrack
  [*]Add trigger_once_mp's
  [*]Tons of Bugfixes
  [*]Get Gene Worm Boss running
[/list]
